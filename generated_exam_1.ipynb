    "## Problem 1:  Random Walks and Hitting Times (15 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a one-dimensional random walk on the integers, where at each step, a particle moves one step to the right with probability $p$ and one step to the left with probability $1-p$. Let $X_n$ denote the position of the particle after $n$ steps. Suppose the particle starts at position $0$, i.e., $X_0 = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **(5 points)** Write a function `simulate_random_walk(n, p)` that simulates a random walk of `n` steps with probability `p` of moving right. The function should return a list of the positions $X_0, X_1, ..., X_n$ of the particle during the walk.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **(5 points)** Suppose $p=0.5$. Write a function `estimate_hitting_time(num_simulations, target)` that estimates the expected number of steps for the particle to reach position `target` for the first time. The function should perform `num_simulations` of random walks, and for each walk, record the first time the particle hits the `target` position. If the target is not reached in 1000 steps, the simulation should be terminated and should not be counted in the estimate. The function should return the average hitting time over all successful simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **(5 points)** For $p=0.6$ and `target=5`, using at least 1000 simulations, estimate the expected hitting time and provide a 95% confidence interval using the bootstrap method. You should use the `makeBootstrappedConfidenceIntervalOfStatisticT` function from ExamJanuary_2020_problem.ipynb, which you can copy into your notebook."
