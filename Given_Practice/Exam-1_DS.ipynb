    "1. Complete the problems by following instructions.\n",
    "2. When done, submit this file with your solutions saved, following the instruction sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exam has 3 problems for a total of 40 points, to pass you need\n",
    "20 points. The bonus will be added to the score of the exam and rounded afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some general hints and information:\n",
    "* Try to answer all questions even if you are uncertain.\n",
    "* Comment your code, so that if you get the wrong answer I can understand how you thought\n",
    "this can give you some points even though the code does not run.\n",
    "* Follow the instruction sheet rigorously.\n",
    "* This exam is partially autograded, but your code and your free text answers are manually graded anonymously.\n",
    "* If there are any questions, please ask the exam guards, they will escalate it to me if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips for free text answers\n",
    "* Be VERY clear with your reasoning, there should be zero ambiguity in what you are referring to.\n",
    "* If you want to include math, you can write LaTeX in the Markdown cells, for instance `$f(x)=x^2$` will be rendered as $f(x)=x^2$ and `$$f(x) = x^2$$` will become an equation line, as follows\n",
    "$$f(x) = x^2$$\n",
    "Another example is `$$f_{Y \\mid X}(y,x) = P(Y = y \\mid X = x) = \\exp(\\alpha \\cdot x + \\beta)$$` which renders as\n",

    "## Finally some rules:\n",
    "* You may not communicate with others during the exam, for example:\n",
    "    * You cannot ask for help in Stack-Overflow or other such help forums during the Exam.\n",
    "    * You may not communicate with AI's, for instance ChatGPT.\n",
    "    * Your on-line and off-line activity is being monitored according to the examination rules.\n",

    "In part 3, we constructed a low-rank approximation of the original data matrix using the first `k` singular components (where `k` is the number needed to explain 95% of the variance). Here's what each row of the approximating matrix represents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Each row in the approximating matrix represents a projection of the original data point (row) onto the subspace spanned by the first `k` principal components (right singular vectors). This effectively reduces the dimensionality while preserving the most important patterns in the data.\n",

    "   - The major trends and correlations between features are preserved\n",

    "   - The reconstruction is optimal in the least-squares sense for the given rank `k`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interpretation**: \n",
    "   - For a given row (data point), the values in the approximating matrix represent how that point would look if we only considered the `k` most significant patterns in the data\n",
    "   - The approximation can be thought of as each original data point being expressed as a weighted combination of the first `k` right singular vectors (principal components)\n",

    "## Free text answer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation for Part 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision about `problem2_comparison` was made by comparing the theoretical average load time without preloading (which is 1.0 second, the mean of an Exp(1) distribution) with the empirical average load time when preloading the most likely next page.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the simulation results:\n",
    "1. The theoretical average load time without preloading is exactly 1.0 second (the mean of Exp(1))\n",
    "2. The empirical average with 1-page preloading was approximately 0.81 seconds\n",
    "3. The empirical average with 2-page preloading was approximately 0.64 seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison `problem2_avg > avg_load_top` evaluates whether the theoretical load time without preloading (1.0s) is greater than the empirical load time with preloading (0.81s), which is clearly true. This shows that preloading does improve the average load time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The improvement comes from:\n",
    "1. When we correctly preload the next page (which happens with probability equal to the transition probability to that page), the load time follows Exp(10) with mean 0.1s\n",
    "2. When we don't correctly preload, the load time follows Exp(1) with mean 1.0s\n",
    "3. The weighted average is significantly lower than 1.0s because even partial success in preloading brings down the average substantially\n",
    "\n",
    "The more pages we preload (e.g., 2 instead of 1), the greater the improvement, as seen by the even lower average of 0.64s when preloading two pages. This makes sense because we're covering more of the probability mass of likely next pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can conclusively say that preloading improves the average load time, and `problem2_comparison` should be set to `True`."

    "**Explanation for Part 4 (Confidence Interval):**\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide a 95% confidence interval around the optimal cost applied to the test data, I made the following key assumptions and methodological choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bootstrap Sampling Approach**:\n",
    "   - Used bootstrap resampling (1000 iterations) to estimate the sampling distribution of the mean cost. This is a robust method that doesn't assume normality of the underlying cost distribution.\n",
    "   - Each bootstrap sample was drawn with replacement from the test data, maintaining the same size as the original test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Normality Assumption**:\n",
    "   - While bootstrap doesn't strictly require normality, for calculating the confidence interval I assumed the sampling distribution of the mean cost is approximately normal (justified by the Central Limit Theorem given a sufficiently large test set).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Independence Assumption**:\n",
    "   - Assumed all test samples are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), meaning the cost of one prediction doesn't affect others.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Threshold Stability**:\n",
    "   - Assumed the optimal threshold determined on validation data remains optimal for the test data (no significant distribution shift).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Statistical Method**:\n",
    "   - Calculated the standard error from the bootstrap samples and used the normal distribution's z-score (1.96 for 95% CI) to determine the margin of error.\n",
    "   - The confidence interval is constructed as: mean_cost ± (z * standard_error)\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach gives us a range where we can be 95% confident that the true expected cost of our classifier (using the optimal threshold) would fall when deployed on new, similar data. The width of the interval reflects both the variability in our cost estimates and the size of our test set."
